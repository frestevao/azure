# HELLO WORLD!
My name is Estevão (aka Este) and this is my library of Azure automations/scripts that I built to solve issues/problems/requests, etc.  Every automation published on this repository will have a specific post on [my blog](https://techf.cloud).

Fell free to download these automations and use, but make sure to test it properly before running on production environments.
